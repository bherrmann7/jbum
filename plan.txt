switch layout to use jbum.json

P1:  get all photos on to web site
P2:  get rid of "done/ready"

switch from jbum.ser to jbum.json or jbum.edn ?
 - easier to edit from command line
 - more universal
 - decouple jbum internals from file format



 Ideas
  - move from swing to web based application
  - 1 app for posting images and editing stories?
