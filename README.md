# jbum

Jbum was originally intended to be used any anyone, but it lately it has devolved into a bit of a mess that only I think I would use.

There be dragons...

A simple application for taking a directory of photos and turning them into a web page with optional comments and styling.  

The goal is to tell a story with pictures and words.  Jbum helps create a page which represents this story.
